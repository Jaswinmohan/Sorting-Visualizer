# Sorting Visualizer - Java GUI Project

## Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based project that offers an interactive way to understand various sorting algorithms through real-time visualizations. By providing a Graphical User Interface (GUI), this project allows users to see the step-by-step process of different sorting algorithms, making it an educational and engaging tool for learning.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user-friendly interface that enables easy interaction with the sorting algorithms.
  
- **Sorting Algorithms:** The visualizer supports several sorting algorithms, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch the sorting algorithms in action as they animate each step of the sorting process.

- **Adjustable Speed:** Control the speed of the sorting animation to slow down or speed up the visualization according to your preference.


## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application:** Start the Sorting Visualizer GUI.
   
2. **Select a Sorting Algorithm:** Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort).

3. **Adjust Speed:** Use the speed control feature to adjust the sorting animation speed to your liking.

4. **Visualize Sorting:** Click the "Visualize" button to start the sorting process. The visualizer will animate the chosen algorithm, displaying each step of the sorting process.

5. **Explore:** Once sorting is complete, you can try different algorithms or modify the input data to explore more.
